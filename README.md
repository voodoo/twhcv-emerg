# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Deployment to Vercel

This project is configured for easy deployment to Vercel.

### Prerequisites

- A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup)
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) (optional, for command-line deployment)

### Deployment Methods

#### Method 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Import your repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect the framework and use the configuration in `vercel.json`
5. Click "Deploy"

#### Method 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Login to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. Deploy from the project root:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to complete the deployment

5. For production deployment:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Configuration

The project includes:
- `vercel.json` - Deployment configuration with custom build commands and routing rules
- `.vercelignore` - Files and directories to exclude from deployment

### Important Notes

- The project uses `--legacy-peer-deps` flag for npm installations due to peer dependency conflicts
- Build output is generated in the `build` directory
- The app uses React Router, so all routes are redirected to `index.html` for proper client-side routing
- Make sure all environment variables are set in the Vercel dashboard under Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables

### Build Verification

Before deploying, verify the build works locally:
```bash
npm run build
```

The build should complete successfully with output in the `build` folder.
