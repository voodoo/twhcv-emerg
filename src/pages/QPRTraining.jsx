            <h2>What is QPR?</h2>
            <p>
              QPR stands for Question, Persuade, and Referâ€”the three simple steps that anyone can 
              learn to help save a life from suicide. Just as people trained in CPR and the Heimlich 
              Maneuver help save thousands of lives each year, people trained in QPR learn how to 
              recognize the warning signs of a suicide crisis and how to question, persuade, and refer 
              someone to help.

              <h3>Question</h3>
              <p>
                Question the individual directly about suicidal thoughts. Research shows that asking 
                someone if they are thinking about suicide does not increase suicides or suicidal 
                thoughts. In fact, it can provide relief and be the first step toward recovery.

              <h3>Persuade</h3>
              <p>
                Persuade the person to seek and accept help. Listen without judgment and offer hope. 
                Let them know that help is available and that suicidal thoughts are temporary. Most 
                people who survive a suicide attempt are glad they lived.

              <h3>Refer</h3>
              <p>
                Refer the individual to appropriate resources. This might include calling the Veterans 
                Crisis Line (988, press 1), accompanying them to a mental health professional, or helping 
                them access emergency services if needed.
